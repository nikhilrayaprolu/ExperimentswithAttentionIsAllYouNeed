Goal Experiments 1:

Expect this repo to be filled with experiments with AttentionisAllYouNeed extensions by 31st March 2018

Possibile Experiments I would say are:
Using it with Summarization
Check how it is working with Rare words and add Pointer - Generator paradigm to it
Adding Diversity Cell or coverage model to stop repeating the same phrases/words
